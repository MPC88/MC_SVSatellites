Arrr, th' mod load fer th' satellites be failin'!
Arrr-ticulated Hook
A contraption o' metal limbs workin' by distant command.
Only one Swashbucklin' Arm be allowed to be installed, matey!
Nary a satellite in th' hold, matey.
Sky Lantern
A movable sky-eye fitted with a ship's scanner, showin' concealed wreckage heaps and sendin' live intel to yer vessel's mind. Beware, once ye set sail with these sky-fishers, they be lost to the brine, never to return, only to be sent to Davy Jones. Needs a trusty arm to launch, savvy?
